**Title:** I built an app to remotely monitor and control Antigravity AI from your phone - Just released v0.2.17 with a new Glassmorphism UI!

Hey everyone!

I've been working on **Antigravity Phone Connect**, a tool that lets you step away from your desk while keeping full sight and control over your Antigravity AI coding sessions. If you've ever felt "tethered" to your computer waiting for a large generation or long thought process to finish, this is for you.

We just pushed v0.2.17, which really hones in on visual polish and compatibility:

✨ **Glassmorphism UI:** We overhauled the mobile quick-action and settings headers using a clean glassmorphism styling. It just feels so much more premium in the hand.
🌙 **Better Dark Mode & Model Tracking:** Since Antigravity relies heavily on themes (with thousands of CSS variables), we refined our "Aggressive CSS Inheritance" to perfectly mask out desktop scrollbars and correctly map dark mode state. Your AI models (like the newest Claude and Gemini drops) are also tracked flawlessly.
🧠 **Always Up To Date:** Confirmed support for the latest AI models.

**How it works under the hood (for the curious):**
Instead of brittle element selection, the Node server establishes a CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) bridge to the desktop IDE. It polls the UI, does delta-detection on the HTML hash, dynamically strips out desktop context bars in real-time, and beams it to your phone over WebSocket.

I'd love for you to check out the repo and let me know what you think!

🚀 Antigravity Phone Connect v0.2.13 is Live! (supports latest release)

I just shipped another batch of updates to my open-source project that bridges the gap between your desktop AI editor (Antigravity) and your mobile device. In this release, the focus was on rock-solid reliability and a cleaner mobile distraction-free view.

What's New (v0.2.7 - v0.2.13):
🧹 Aggressive Mobile Cleanup — We've stripped out even more desktop noise. No more "Review Changes" or "Linked Object" bars cluttering your phone screen.
🤖 Reliable Model Selection — A new multi-strategy selector makes switching between AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT) faster and more reliable than ever.
📖 Documentation Refresh — Completely overhauled README and technical docs to make onboarding even easier for new developers.
🛡️ Stability Patches — Smarter process management and bug fixes for a smoother mirroring experience.

This tool is perfect for those "away-from-keyboard" moments when you still need to keep an eye on your AI's generations.
