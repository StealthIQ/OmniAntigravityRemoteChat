🚀 Antigravity Phone Connect v0.2.13 is Live! (supports latest release)

I just shipped another batch of updates to my open-source project that bridges the gap between your desktop AI editor (Antigravity) and your mobile device. In this release, the focus was on rock-solid reliability and a cleaner mobile distraction-free view.

What's New (v0.2.7 - v0.2.13):
🧹 Aggressive Mobile Cleanup — We've stripped out even more desktop noise. No more "Review Changes" or "Linked Object" bars cluttering your phone screen.
🤖 Reliable Model Selection — A new multi-strategy selector makes switching between AI models (Gemini, Claude, GPT) faster and more reliable than ever.
📖 Documentation Refresh — Completely overhauled README and technical docs to make onboarding even easier for new developers.
🛡️ Stability Patches — Smarter process management and bug fixes for a smoother mirroring experience.

This tool is perfect for those "away-from-keyboard" moments when you still need to keep an eye on your AI's generations.
